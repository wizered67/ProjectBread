# ProjectBread
##Overview
ProjectBread is a simple platformer game developed with [LibGDX] (https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) that runs on computers and Android phones and tablets. The goal of this project was to become more familiar with LibGDX while learning how to implement many features common in platformers. The game uses LibGDX's [Box2D] (http://box2d.org/about/) extension for the physics system which allows for realistic physics. However, a lot of effort went into making the game's physics feel fun and easy for platforming. A large inspiration for the platforming was the game Shovel Knight, as well as classic platformers like Mario and Mega Man.
