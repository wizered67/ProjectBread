# ProjectBread (Spring 2016)
## Overview
ProjectBread is a simple platformer game developed with [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) that runs on computers and Android phones and tablets. The goal of this project was to become more familiar with LibGDX while learning how to implement many features common in platformers. The game uses LibGDX's [Box2D](http://box2d.org/about/) extension for the physics system which allows for realistic physics. However, a lot of effort went into making the game's physics feel fun and easy for platforming. A large inspiration for the platforming was the game Shovel Knight, as well as classic platformers like Mario and Mega Man.

## Features
* Carefully tweaked game physics that feel satisfying and precise. 
* Holding the jump button lets the player jump higher for more precision jumping.
* Blocks that can be pushed around and jumped on to reach new areas.
* Platforms that can be jumped through from below.
* Platforms that fall after the player steps on them, taking the player down too if they don't jump off.
* Platforms that move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally and carry the player with them.
